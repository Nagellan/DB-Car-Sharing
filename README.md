# DB-Car-Sharing
Assignment for Data Modeling and Databases subject at Innopolis University, 3rd semester
* All documents are available [here](https://github.com/Nagellan/DB-Car-Sharing/tree/master/docs) in PDF format (task descriptions for all assignments, solutions for first two ones).

## Specifications
You will implement ER diagrams from [previous phase](https://github.com/Nagellan/DB-Car-Sharing/blob/master/docs/Assignment%202.pdf) using either **MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite** as a backend database engine. Your implementation must be in **Python3 or Java programming language**. You will need to implement the structure of the database (tables with relations), provide sample data for your tables and provide implementation of SELECT queries. Please note that the implementation may require you to iterate over your ER design and fine-tune it.

## Goals
1. **Create database structure:** convert your ER diagram into a real database using Data Definition Language (DDL). Keep in mind that your database structure must also preserve integrity and consistency of your data and must be in the **third normal form**.
2. **Populate your database with sample data:** provide sample data for each table (**HINT:** writing a Python3 script or Java to generate data may save you some time).
3. **Implement SELECT queries:** write a Python3 script or Java that will interact with your database and perform select queries (see below for list of queries).
3. **Design an interface to access the queries via the programming language of your choice.**
